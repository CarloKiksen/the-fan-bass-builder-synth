# the-fan-bass-builder-synth
A web-based acid bass synthesizer inspired by retro hardware. I built it using Gemini Canvas, to show artists how to built digital artist merch and use AI for ideation. I've captured the process in my newsletter The Fanbase Builder. The sythn is a web-app with a single HTML file using Tone.js for audio and Tailwind CSS for the interface.

- Run the synth in GitHub Pages - https://github.com/CarloKiksen/the-fan-bass-builder-synth
